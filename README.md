## Installation

1. Open the GlintTest.xcworkspace file found in GlintTest/GlintTest.xcworkspace
2. Xcode -> File -> Packages -> Resolve Package Versions
3. Build and run

## Project overview

This project focuses on matching Glint's UI to (hopefully) show my attention to detail!

Built using MVVM-C and UIKit, as well as a reusable Xcode template for MVVM-C to ensure Clean Architecture.

Given more time I would've applied formatting to the UILabels rather than using raw strings i.e. "0.0000g". or "0.00 GBP".

Thanks!
